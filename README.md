# README

To get started, clone this codebase, and in the project's directory in the terminal, run the following commands:

```
bundle
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed
```

You will also have to create an application.yml file in the `config` folder. You must ask your project leader for the code for this file, as it contains sensitive information that cannot be published on Github.
